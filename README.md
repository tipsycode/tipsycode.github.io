# Tipsy Coder

This repository contains a simple static page for the **Tipsy Coder** project. It displays a heading, a short greeting, and an image loaded from an external source. The goal is to show how easily a basic site can be deployed with GitHub Pages.

## Viewing the page

Open `index.html` locally in your browser, or enable GitHub Pages on this repository with the main branch as its source. Once enabled, navigate to `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository>` to see the page online.

The HTML uses an image hosted by Codecademy.
